# Naive Bayes with PySpark!

In this project, PySpark was used to build a Naive-Bayes classifier to determine the sentiment of a comment. For that, was used a database with approximately 1.5GB of data, which amounts to 3.6 million comments. Spark was used to efficiently handle this large amount of data.
